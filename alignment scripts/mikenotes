GloVe orig -> para is quite bad

ELMo src -> para is okay
	my metric has bads after 3.0

	src -> orig sim has the same 0.9
	dist is questionable again
	joint ~0.3
	
	orig -> para sim 0.58
	orig -> para joint 2.5
	
	align -> para sim 0.9
	align -> para dist 5.0
	align -> para joint 0.4

look at sim and dist metrics for:
	src
	tgt/aligned
	swappable
	para
	
sanity check:
	build artificial examples (bug, plank, etc.)
	half good, half bad
	condition on number of occurances the swap has been seen
	
double check w2v and glove comparisons
